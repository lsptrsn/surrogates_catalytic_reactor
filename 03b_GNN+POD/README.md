## Getting started?
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:
1. Run the `GNN_POD_run.py` script. This script generates a surrogate model of the reactor dynamics using GNN on reduced data and also performs the evaluation. The hyperparameters used here are those found in 03a_GNN with unreduced data.

## Runtime
On the given computing system, the code runs within ~ 2500 s.
