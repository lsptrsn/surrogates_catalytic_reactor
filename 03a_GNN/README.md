## Getting started?
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:
1. Run the `GNN_hyperparameter_optuna.py` script. This script generates finds the optimal hyperparameter for creating a surrogate model of the reactor dynamics using GNN.
2. Run the `GNN_run.py` script. This script generates a surrogate model of the reactor dynamics using GNN and also performs the evaluation. The hyperparameters used here are those found via step 1.

## Runtime
On the given computing system, the code runs within ~ 4000 s.
